ITGS project

Github was not used for version control (I used Plastic SCM). This project file is uploaded after I finished the project development. 
If you want to look at the code:
Assets -> Scripts -> opens cs files by double clicking. 
If you want to download the project:
<> Code -> Download Zip.
I used Unity version 2021.3.8f1
